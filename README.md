# Berkeley Wild Food Map
A fun, interactive map visualizing the edible plants I find around town and campus. The dataset changes somewhat regularly. As I created this dataset from scratch, please credit me if you decide to use it.

The plot was generated in Python using Plotly + Mapbox, and has an interactive version located at: https://plot.ly/~mlawrence95/4

NOTE: Some of these foods are growing in potentially polluted areas. I make no claim that these are all safe to eat.

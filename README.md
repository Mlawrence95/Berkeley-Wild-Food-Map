# Berkeley Wild Food Map
A fun, interactive map made in Python visualizing the edible plants I find around town and campus. The dataset changes somewhat regularly.

The plot was generated using Plotly + Mapbox, and has an interactive version located at: https://plot.ly/~mlawrence95/4

NOTE: Some of these foods are growing in potentially polluted areas. I make no claim that these are all safe to eat.
